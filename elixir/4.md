# IO.inspect Opts

`Inspect.Opts` for a description of the available options:

---
:limit - limits the number of items that are printed for tuples, bitstrings, maps, lists and any other collection of items. It does not apply to strings nor charlists and defaults to 50. If you don't want to limit the number of items to a particular number, use :infinity.
Thus you can pass limit: :infinity to print all elements:
